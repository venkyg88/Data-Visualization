# Data-Visualization
Fundamentals, design, data visualization tools and creating dashboards


It's important to gain insights on data which will help us to make the right decisions.
Usually, the most compelling way to communicate information about data id visually. But creating good visualizations really combines two skills -
First, there is a design and artistic component to create something that is beautiful and compelling.
And then, there is a strong scientific and mathematical component in being able to deliver the right insights.

So it's important to build data visualizations and do so in a way that is engaging and informative.

There are two major areas of focus :
Why are data visualizations more useful for delivering insight than just using summary statistics?
What plot do you build in a given situation?



Categorical variable
Categorical variables contain a finite number of categories or distinct groups. Categorical data might not have a logical order. For example, categorical predictors include gender, material type, and payment method.
Discrete variable
Discrete variables are numeric variables that have a countable number of values between any two values. A discrete variable is always numeric. For example, the number of customer complaints or the number of flaws or defects.
Continuous variable
Continuous variables are numeric variables that have an infinite number of values between any two values. A continuous variable can be numeric or date/time. For example, the length of a part or the date and time a payment is received.
Ordinal variable
An ordinal variable is a categorical variable for which the possible values are ordered. Ordinal variables can be considered “in between” categorical and quantitative variables. Example: Educational level might be categorized as. 1: Elementary school education. 2: High school graduate.
